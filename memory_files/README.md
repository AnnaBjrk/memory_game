# Memory Game

A description of [Memorygame](https://github.com/AnnaBjrk/memory_game).
This is a Memory game developed as part of a Python course at KTH.
It is basically coded entirely without AI assistance. The part where an AI contributed a little is in the development of the wxPython variant. Tkinter turned out to be not particularly compatible with Mac, so to create a nicer interface, the wxPython version was made afterwards, which has more colors among other things.

The game is made in Python and wxPython.
There is also a Tkinter version - but unfortunately Tkinter is not so compatible with Mac - so the result was a bit lacking. With wxPython, some colors and styling were added.
